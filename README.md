# Machine Learning

This repository contains Python implementation of five machine learning algorithms from scratch to enhance understanding of their inner workings. Additionally, a dataset of 10000 datapoints. Each datapoint contains 10 features and one output column which is +1 or -1.

## List of Algorithms:
  - Perceptron
  - Kernel Perceptron
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using the Pegasos algorithm
  - kernelized Pegasos with the Gaussian and the polynomial kernels for SVM
  - Regularized logistic classification
